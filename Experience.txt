This is Ankesh and it's been more than a month now in IITP. 
Talking about experiences, since I belong to Bihar itself, so I somewhat thought of
getting familiar environment where I would be comfortable but when I visited the campus 
during registration, I saw a large group was not actually Hindi-speaking and I was surprised to know that Telugu people are more in interested in IITP than the Bihari people.
By the way, my other experiences are good till now and hope that I get to know this 
campus more in near future.
